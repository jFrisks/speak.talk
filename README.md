# Speak.talk - A simple programming language with the syntax of natural written English.
A language and a compiler that can execute code and print results. Everything from Scanning to Machine Code, except optimization.
Works as a proof of concept to write normal written English without the knowledge of any particular language. 

Written in Java, using JastAdd.

Future Ideas:
- More flexible english syntax using AI or advanced Regex. (Scanning will tokenize the same)
- More features

## Credits
Based on a private repo from project ([@lucasedlund](https://github.com/LucasEdlund) and [@jfrisks](https://github.com/jfrisks).) in a compilers course at Lund University. Together we built a basic compiler.
