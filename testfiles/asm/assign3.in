A function that is called main and returns an integer. It runs the following:
  - an integer that is called x.
  - the variable that is called x has the value of the function that is called f that uses the arguments of 3 subtracted by 2.
  - an integer that is called y and has the value of the function that is called g that uses the arguments of 3, 42.
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called x.
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called y.
  - finally return 1.
