  x = f(3 - 2);
  - an integer that is called y and has the value of g(3, 42);
  print(x);
  print(y);
  - finally return 1;
}

int f(an integer that is called a){
  print(a);
  - an integer that is called y and has the value of g(3, a);
  - finally return y;

}

int g(an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b){
  - an integer that is called x and has the value of a + b;
  - finally return a * b * x;
