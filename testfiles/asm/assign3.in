A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - an integer that is called x.
  - the variable that is called x = the value of the function f that uses the arguments of 3 subtracted by 2;
  - an integer that is called y and has the value of the value of the function g that uses the arguments of 3, 42;
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called x;
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called y;
  - finally return 1;
.

int the value of the function f that uses the arguments of an integer that is called a{
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called a;
  - an integer that is called y and has the value of the value of the function g that uses the arguments of 3, the variable that is called a;
  - finally return y;

.

A function that is called g and uses the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - an integer that is called x and has the value of the variable that is called a added to b;
  - finally return the variable that is called a multiplied with the variable that is called b multiplied with x;
