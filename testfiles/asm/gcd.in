A function that is called main and returns an integer. It runs the following:
    - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function that is called gcd1 that uses the arguments of 24, 20.
    - finally return 1.
.

A function that is called gcd1 and returns an integer by using the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It runs the following:
    - loop while the variable that is called a is not equal to b. Run the following code each time:
        - if the variable that is called a is greater than b, do the following:
            - the variable that is called a has the value of the variable that is called a subtracted by the variable that is called b.
        .
        - else, do:
            - the variable that is called b has the value of the variable that is called b subtracted by the variable that is called a.
        .
    .
    - finally return a.
