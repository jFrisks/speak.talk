A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
    - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function gcd1 that uses the arguments of 24, 20.
    - finally return 1.
.

A function that is called gcd1 and uses the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
    - loop while the variable that is called a is not equal to b. Run the following code each time:
        - if the variable that is called a is greater than b, do the following:
            - the variable that is called a has the value of the variable that is called a subtracted by the variable that is called b.
        .
        - else, do:
            - the variable that is called b has the value of the variable that is called b subtracted by the variable that is called a.
        .
    .
    - finally return a.
