A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
      // depth = 1
      - an integer that is called i and has the value of 100;
      - loop while the variable that is called i is greater than 0. Run the following code each time:
        // depth = 2
        - if the variable that is called i is equal to 5, do the following:
// depth = 3
- run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called i; .
- the variable that is called i = the variable that is called i subtracted by 1; .
      - if the variable that is called i is equal to 0, do the following:
        // depth = 2
        - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called i;
      .
      // depth = 1
      - finally return 0;
.
