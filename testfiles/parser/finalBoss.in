A function that is called gcd1 and returns an integer by using the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It runs the following:
  - loop while the variable that is called a is not equal to the variable that is called b. Run the following  each time:
    - if the variable that is called a is greater than the variable that is called b, do the following:
      - the variable that is called a has the value of the variable that is called a subtracted by the variable that is called b.
    - else, do:
      - the variable that is called b has the value of the variable that is called b subtracted by the variable that is called a.
    .
  .
  - finally return the variable that is called a.
.
A function that is called gcd2 and returns an integer by using the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It runs the following:
  - if the variable that is called b is equal to 0, do the following:
    - finally return the variable that is called a.
  .
  - finally return the value of the function that is called gcd2 and uses the arguments of the variable that is called b, the variable that is called a modulo b.
.
// Test two different GCD algorithms and print the results.
// The results should be equal when both inputs are positive.
A function that is called main and returns an integer. It runs the following:
  - an integer that is called a.
  - an integer that is called b.
  - the variable that is called a has the value of the function that is called read.
  - the variable that is called b has the value of the function that is called read.
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function that is called gcd1 and uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b.
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function that is called gcd2 and uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b.
  - an integer that is called diff and has the value of the function that is called gcd1 and uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b subtracted by the value of the function that is called gcd2 and uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b.
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called diff.
  - finally return 0.
