A function that is called gcd1 and uses the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - loop while the variable that is called a is not equal to b. Run the following code each time:
    - if the variable that is called a is greater than b, do the following:
      - the variable that is called a = the variable that is called a subtracted by the variable that is called b;
    .
    - else, do:
      - the variable that is called b = the variable that is called b subtracted by the variable that is called a;
    .
  .
  - finally return a;
.
A function that is called gcd2 and uses the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - if the variable that is called b is equal to 0, do the following:
    - finally return a;
  .
  - finally return the value of the function gcd2 that uses the arguments of the variable that is called b, the variable that is called a modulo b;
.
// Test two different GCD algorithms and print the results.
// The results should be equal when both inputs are positive.
A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - an integer that is called a.
  - an integer that is called b.
  - the variable that is called a = the function that is called read;
  - the variable that is called b = the function that is called read;
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function gcd1 that uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b;
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function gcd2 that uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b;
  - an integer that is called diff and has the value of the value of the function gcd1 that uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b subtracted by the value of the function gcd2 that uses the arguments of the variable that is called a, the variable that is called b;
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called diff;
  - finally return 0;
