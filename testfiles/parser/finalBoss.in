A function that is called gcd1 and uses the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  while (a != b) {
    if (a > b) {
      a = a - b;
    } else {
      b = b - a;
    }
  }
  - finally return a;
}
A function that is called gcd2 and uses the arguments of an integer that is called a, an integer that is called b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  if (b == 0) {
    - finally return a;
  }
  - finally return gcd2(b, a % b);
}
// Test two different GCD algorithms and print the results.
// The results should be equal when both inputs are positive.
A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - an integer that is called a.
  - an integer that is called b.
  a = read();
  b = read();
  print(gcd1(a, b));
  print(gcd2(a, b));
  - an integer that is called diff and has the value of gcd1(a, b) - gcd2(a, b);
  print(diff);
  - finally return 0;
