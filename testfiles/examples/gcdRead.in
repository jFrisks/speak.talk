A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - an integer that is called x has the value of the function read.
  - an integer that is called y has the value of the function read.

  - the function that is called print and uses the arguments x multiplied with y.
.

A function that is called gcd1 and uses the arguments of the integer a, the integer b. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - loop while the integer a is not equal to the integer b. Run the following code each time:
    - if the integer a is greater than the integer b, do the following:
      - assign the integer a to be the integer a minus the integer a.
    - else, do:
      - assign the integer b to be the integer b minus the integer a.
      .
    -
    .
  - finally return the integer a.
