A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
  - an integer that is called x and has the value of 0;
  - an integer that is called sum and has the value of 0;
  - loop while the variable that is called x is less than 10. Run the following code each time:
    - if the variable that is called x is less than 3, do the following:
      - an integer that is called x.
      - the variable that is called x = 13;
      - the variable that is called sum = the variable that is called sum added to x;
    .
    - the variable that is called sum = the variable that is called sum added to 1;
    - the variable that is called x = the variable that is called x added to 1;
  .
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called sum;
