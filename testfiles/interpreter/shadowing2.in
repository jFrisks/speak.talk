A function that is called main and returns an integer. It runs the following:
  - an integer that is called x and has the value of 0.
  - an integer that is called sum and has the value of 0.
  - loop while the variable that is called x is less than 10. Run the following code each time:
    - if the variable that is called x is less than 3, do the following:
      - an integer that is called x.
      - the variable that is called x has the value of 13.
      - the variable that is called sum has the value of the variable that is called sum added to x.
    .
    - the variable that is called sum has the value of the variable that is called sum added to 1.
    - the variable that is called x has the value of the variable that is called x added to 1.
  .
  - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called sum.
