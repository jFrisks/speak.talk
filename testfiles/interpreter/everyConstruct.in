A function that is called main and returns an integer. It runs the following:
    - an integer that is called i and has the value of 3.
    - loop while the variable that is called i is greater than 0. Run the following code each time:
        - if the variable that is called i is equal to 2, do the following:
            - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called i.
        .
        - the variable that is called i has the value of the variable that is called i subtracted by 1.
        - an integer that is called x.
        - the variable that is called x has the value of 3.
        - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the variable that is called x.
    .
    - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of the value of the function that is called a that uses the arguments of the variable that is called i.
    - run the function that is called print and uses the arguments of 3 is greater than 1.
    - finally return i.
