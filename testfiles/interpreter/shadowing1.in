A function that is called main. It returns an integer by running the following code:
    - an integer that is called i and has the value of 0; // Declaration of i
    if (i == 0) {
        - an integer that is called i and has the value of 1; // Another declaration of i
        if (i == 1) {
            - an integer that is called i and has the value of 2; // A third declaration of i
            print(i); // Prints 2
        }
        print(i); // Prints 1
    }
    print(i); // Prints 0
}
